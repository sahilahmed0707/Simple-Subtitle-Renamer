# Simple-Subtitle-Renamer
A very simple subtitle renamer written in C++17, using filesystem. 
This program renames first n .srt files as the same as the first m .mkv files(if n is not equal to m, it renames till the smaller number items). 
Change the file extensions or path of the folder to work on in the main.cpp file and compile using C++17 compiler.
# Update 
Added path and extension input through the console
